          <h3>What We've Done </h3>
          <img src="ops-div-experience-grid.png" alt="Ops Div Experience Grid">
          <p>Collectively, we've founded tech startups and nonprofits, held senior roles at multinational companies, advised early stage startups, consulted at $20B+ multinationals, sat on nonprofit boards.</p>
          <p>Along the way, we've helped launch new products and navigate product pivots, we've helped companies grow by multiples, transformed the way that teams work together, and defined entirely new metrics in order to understand value.</p>

          <h3>How We Work</h3>
          <p>One tried and true way we work with clients is on an interim basis. When clients have an open role for a critical need, we can fill that role on a part-time basis focusing on the most important areas of support. We then help clients identify someone to fill that role on a permanent basis, help get that person up to speed, and transition out.</p>
          <p>Another tried and true approach reflects traditional consulting methods. We partner with clients to make sense of a current challenge, plan a path forward, and work through the plan, whether that means advising teams, rolling up our sleeves to get work done, or both.</p>
          <p>Our sweet spot is in designing operations for growth. We've worked in high-growth environments, and have observed that collaboration and change practices are often overlooked when growing quickly. This inevitably causes growing pains and ultimately limits growth. We study our clients' change and collaboration practices and help improve these practices before, during and after periods of rapid growth.</p>
